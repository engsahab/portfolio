              I worked on this project with my team as our graduation project.
              The goal was to create a recruitment platform that connects job seekers with employers in an easy and effective way.
              Our platform focuses on inclusion, making it simple for people with special needs to participate and find the right opportunities.
              The system includes:User Accounts (for job seekers & employers) Job Listings (easy to search and filter) Smart Matching Tools that recommend the most suitable jobs for each user.

               My Summer Training Project
               During my summer university training at King Fahd Medical City, my team and I designed and developed a flight ticket booking website. 
               The project aims to make it easy for users to search for available flights, select the most suitable option, and book tickets quickly and securely.
               The system includes user accounts, flight details such as dates, times, and prices, as well as a booking management system to track and organize reservations efficiently.
               Working on this project with my team provided us with valuable hands-on experience in web development, database design, and enhancing user experience.
               Below are some screenshots of the website interface and the key pages we designed together.
